    "Then the data is split to prepare datasets for a machine learning task by separating the features (independent variables) from the target variable (dependent variable) related to accident severity. The train_data, test_data, and validation_data datasets each contain various features along with the 'Accident severity' column, which indicates the severity of an accident. The code first removes the 'Accident severity' column from each dataset to create feature sets (X_train, X_test, and X_val). These feature sets now contain all the data except for the target variable. Next, it extracts the 'Accident severity' column and stores it separately as target variables (y_train, y_test, and y_val). This separation is crucial because it allows machine learning models to learn from the features (X_train), make predictions, and then compare those predictions against the actual outcomes (y_train) to evaluate performance. The test and validation sets serve similar purposes, providing data for assessing the model's generalization capability and fine-tuning, respectively."

Specifically, for class 0.0, the classifier performed exceptionally well with a precision and recall of 0.98 and 1.00, respectively, resulting in an F1-score of 0.99. Class 1.0 showed a precision of 0.82, recall of 0.96, and an F1-score of 0.89. Class 2.0 had a precision of 0.95, recall of 0.77, and an F1-score of 0.85.

    "as we can see, the model has slightly improved after using the hyperperameters, only by 1% compared to the initial 92%. considering how high the random forest classifier model accuracy was, it had little room for improvment, thus the 1% increase was not unexpected when hypertuning the model.\n",

    "The optimal parameters identified for the random forest classifier include disabling bootstrapping, allowing trees to grow to their maximum depth, setting the minimum number of samples per leaf to one, and the minimum number of samples required to split a node to two. Additionally, the model utilizes 100 decision trees. Specifically, the `bootstrap` parameter being set to `False` means that each tree is trained on the entire dataset without sampling. The `max_depth` parameter being `None` allows each tree to grow until all leaves are pure or contain fewer than the minimum samples for a split. The `min_samples_leaf` parameter of `1` indicates that each leaf must have at least one sample, while `min_samples_split` of `2` means that a node must have at least two samples to be split further. Lastly, `n_estimators` set to `100` specifies the number of trees in the forest. These parameters collectively enhance the model's ability to learn from the data and improve its predictive performance by making the ensemble robust and flexible."
